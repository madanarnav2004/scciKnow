# scciKnow
This is my first SwiftUI Project , i was only familiar with the storyboard mode of xcode before this task. 
This task gave me a lot of experience in SwiftUI, Source Control , calling API's etc
I did refer some documentations for help (for eg i was completely new to the openAI API)
I am currently pursuing a certification in iOS Development and Swift
This application is the search assistant application that features a search bar which sends the query to the openai api and displays the result in a place holder just below it 
During a few tests it was having issues with posting the query and displayed the something went wrong message. This is where help is appreciated
